The time sync - 7 slots
Using a hack to put node 4's TX in slot 0 - will this work if 4 is present - hopefully the data send delay will be OK
Sync to slot 1 as usual
Time sync layer is sending its own packets?

The fault generator has its own node... nodes programmed to simulate a fault
Faulty node sends a burst of packets
Direct interference didn't work

When in fault mode; nodes 1) don't request an ACK on packets 2) discard received packets 3) always act as if
ACK wasn't received - tests show it did an extra retransmit

The protocol for the LO crit nodes - what to do with them? (Alan's
mode change idea or mine)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Show that if we don't use the LO suspending protocol... some HIs can
miss their deadlines as a result - use this as a baseline

In future prototype, use a variable length slot header... to start off the table

Test out what the slot lengths can go down to... when are the warnings received?
Can the notification packet and the MCCpackets be merged? - something to think about for the long term

Can something that arrived in the previous slot be sent? (does this still work under small slots)
if it can't try selecting the message to sent in the previous slot

Are the deadlines in the graph the analytical response times?
